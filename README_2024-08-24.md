## Solution Plan for 2024-08-24

### Post Content:
Hello! Even though there is a nationwide shortage of accountants, interest in this sub is at an all-time high. If you're new here, some reminders:

**1) This sub is for those in the tax preparation profession only.**  
This doesn't mean you have to have a CPA or EA, or be the direct tax preparer. Anyone working for a tax preparation firm/office can be part of this sub. That means the IT person, the front desk, the firm admin, etc.

**2) This is a restricted sub.**  
That means you must be approved to post here. With the flood here in the last couple of weeks of folks wanting to become approved users, here's a new rule, at least for tax season: ***You must have some post or comment history in this sub in order to be approved.*** This will help indicate you're not going to post about 'why my tax return hasn't deposited yet', or whether you should be an 'LLC' in order to get 'tax heavens'.

**3) Adhere to sub rules.**  
Basically, have User Flair set and stay on-topic and don't be a jerk. Tax questions (not pertaining to recent rules) should go in r/tax or r/technicaltax. This is more about software, IRS/state agency issues, etc. If you can't find the right flair for your post, double-check that it is an appropriate topic for this post.

**4) Good luck this year!**  
It's a leap year, so even though the tax deadline falls on Apr 15, we technically get an extra day.

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

**Problem 1: Difficulty in getting approved to post**

To address this pain point, I recommend implementing an AI-powered approval process using a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze user requests for posting approval. The LLM can be trained on a dataset of approved and rejected posts to learn the characteristics of approved users. This will enable the model to accurately identify and approve new users who meet the community's requirements.

**Solution 2: Streamlining the approval process**

To make the approval process more efficient, I suggest creating a dedicated approval workflow on Make.com, an automation platform. This workflow can be triggered by a user's request for posting approval and will automatically send a message to the mod team for review and approval. Once approved, the user will receive a notification and will be able to post in the community.

**Solution 3: Enhancing user engagement and on-topic posting**

To encourage users to stay on-topic and engage with the community, I recommend implementing a Machine Learning-based sentiment analysis tool to monitor and analyze user comments. This tool can identify and flag off-topic or inflammatory comments, and the mod team can then take appropriate action. Additionally, I suggest creating a community-driven wiki or FAQ section to provide users with quick access to relevant information and reduce the number of repetitive questions.

**Solution 4: Providing a seamless user experience**

To address the issue of posts not showing up in users' feeds, I recommend implementing a Reddit-algorithm-based solution to improve post visibility. This can be achieved by using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze user engagement patterns and prioritize relevant posts.

**Timeline:**

* Week 1-2: Train the LLM on a dataset of approved and rejected posts to develop an accurate approval process.
* Week 3-4: Create the approval workflow on Make.com and integrate it with the LLM.
* Week 5-6: Implement the sentiment analysis tool and community-driven wiki/FAQ section.
* Week 7-8: Launch the updated approval process and community features.

**Solution Map:**

1. Integrate LLM with Make.com to automate approval process.
2. Create community-driven wiki/FAQ section to provide users with quick access to relevant information.
3. Implement sentiment analysis tool to monitor and analyze user comments.
4. Launch updated approval process and community features.
5. Monitor and analyze user engagement patterns to improve post visibility.
6. Refine and iterate on the solution based on user feedback and performance metrics.

## Solution Plan for 2024-08-24

### Post Content:
Hey all. Reading through tons of posts on here have finally inspired me to make the jump and start my own firm in NY. For now it’s going to be a side gig doing mostly 1040s with the hopes it will be full time at some point in the future. 

Originally I was going to register with NY as a sole prop, but then a friend of mine who has a solo firm said to just start out as a PLLC. After researching, it looks like it will take around 12-14 weeks for it to be approved by the state, which won’t leave much time to get other registrations like EIN, EFIN, bank accounts, insurance, etc. 

Has anyone else registered in NY recently as a PLLC and had the same wait time? Would it be a headache to start as a sole prop and switch to PLLC in a couple years? I don’t want to be rushing to get everything set up right before tax season comes along if it will take that long to get approved.

Solution Plan:

The pain point being discussed is the uncertainty and potential headache of registering as a PLLC in New York state, specifically the 12-14 week wait time for approval. The entrepreneur is considering starting as a sole prop and potentially switching to a PLLC in the future. The comments provided offer insights into the potential drawbacks of registering as a PLLC, including the need for annual renewal and reporting requirements, additional fees, and limitations on services and partnerships.

To address this pain point, I recommend the following solution plan:

1. AI Agent: Develop an AI agent that can assist with the registration process, providing guidance on the necessary steps and timelines for both sole prop and PLLC registrations. The AI agent can also help with obtaining necessary registrations, such as EIN, EFIN, and bank accounts.
2. Large Language Model (LLM): Utilize an LLM to analyze the comments provided and identify the potential drawbacks of registering as a PLLC. The LLM can also help to identify potential red flags or areas of concern that may arise during the registration process.
3. Automation Platform: Create an automation platform using Make.com to streamline the registration process, including setting up EIN, EFIN, and bank accounts, as well as obtaining insurance and other necessary registrations.
4. Machine Learning: Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze the entrepreneur's workflow and identify areas where automation can be applied to reduce the workload and increase efficiency.

Timeline:

Hey r/tax, I'm a relatively new mod to this group in the last 3-6 months, looks like the long time mod quakerots left a few months back and quite a few of the AutoMod actions are outdated from the pandemic, so I'm looking at updating the rules and AutoMod commenting and would like to get feedback from subreddit users

As a reference, [here's the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/3zf1bs/before_you_post_see_if_you_can_find_your_answer/) that used to be pinned with a bunch of the IRS links, unfortunately I don't think people in general tend to look at pinned posts if they're looking to get a specific question answered

**AMA Announcement**: There will be an [AMA on Feb 12th with USAToday](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1anizkt/upcoming_usa_today_ama_feb_12th_noon_to_3_pm_et/) personal finance team 12-3pm ET

## Rules

### [Current Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/about/rules/)

They're pretty simple - be nice, don't solicit business, no self promotion

### New Rules

No AI generated comments/content - it's low quality, and we're not here to be AI fact checkers

No discussion of tax fraud - openly suggesting/supporting tax fraud calls into question the reliability of the comments here, of course people should always take reddit advice with a grain of salt, but suggesting fraud on top of that just degrades the subreddit

**Anything else specific that frequent subreddit users would like to see added?**

## AutoMod Commenter

I've removed all the oudated auto-comments/removal, here are the new ones I'm thinking of adding - note that these would just be an FYI comment on the post, the post itself would not be removed, just saves frequent users the effort of linking the same things or re-iterating the frequently asked questions around this time of year

 -  **Explaining how tax brackets work** - users could comment "!ELI5taxes", AutoMod would reply with a breakdown that's frequently repeated here - if someone has a preferred example they've seen here please link it in the comments

 -  **Explaining how tax refund works** - users could comment "!ELI5refund", AutoMod would reply with the paying cash at the grocery store example plus explaining lower refund vs lower paychecks

 -  **Return vs refund** - I've seen this one frequently mentioned as an AutoMod request, but I suspect figuring out the right regex trigger would be tricky as I wouldn't want it to just be blindly commented on every single post mentioning a tax return or refund

 -  **IRS withholding estimator** - [links to tool](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) for updating W4(s) with summary of frequent mistakes like double counting dependents for married couples or not properly accounting for multiple jobs

 -  **Dependents** - links to [IRS dependent tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/whom-may-i-claim-as-a-dependent), if someone wants to draft a summary with it then you're welcome to comment it here, just not sure if that's necessary as it could get lengthy 

 -  **Do I have to file** - link to [IRS tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return) plus summary

 -  **Others** - wishlist that may be helpful, but not sure if these are really needed/not sure of regex trigger

  - $600 threshold for 1099-K

  - Do I have to include x income?

  - How do I report income without a 1099/Do I have to? (similar to previous)

  - When will I get my refund?

 - 1099 vs W2 misclassification

 - Can I claim x if I work from home? (Think these have mostly died down the last 1-2 years)

**Open to any reasonable/genuine feedback on these from frequent users of the subreddit**
