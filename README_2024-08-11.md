## Solution Plan for 2024-08-11

### Post Content:
Hello! Even though there is a nationwide shortage of accountants, interest in this sub is at an all-time high. If you're new here, some reminders:

**1) This sub is for those in the tax preparation profession only.**  
This doesn't mean you have to have a CPA or EA, or be the direct tax preparer. Anyone working for a tax preparation firm/office can be part of this sub. That means the IT person, the front desk, the firm admin, etc.

**2) This is a restricted sub.**  
That means you must be approved to post here. With the flood here in the last couple of weeks of folks wanting to become approved users, here's a new rule, at least for tax season: ***You must have some post or comment history in this sub in order to be approved.*** This will help indicate you're not going to post about 'why my tax return hasn't deposited yet', or whether you should be an 'LLC' in order to get 'tax heavens'.

**3) Adhere to sub rules.**  
Basically, have User Flair set and stay on-topic and don't be a jerk. Tax questions (not pertaining to recent rules) should go in r/tax or r/technicaltax. This is more about software, IRS/state agency issues, etc. If you can't find the right flair for your post, double-check that it is an appropriate topic for this post.

**4) Good luck this year!**  
It's a leap year, so even though the tax deadline falls on Apr 15, we technically get an extra day.

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The pain point identified in the Reddit post and comments is the difficulty in getting approved to post in the restricted sub. The sub moderators have implemented new rules to ensure that only relevant and on-topic discussions take place. The goal is to create a solution that utilizes AI agents, large language models, and automation platforms to streamline the approval process.

**Step 1:** Develop an AI-powered chatbot using a large language model (LLM) to assist with user queries and provide information about the sub's rules and requirements. The chatbot will be integrated with the sub's moderation tools to help users understand the approval process and provide guidance on how to improve their chances of getting approved.

**Step 2:** Create an automated workflow using Make.com to connect the AI chatbot with the sub's moderation tools. The workflow will be designed to:

* Monitor user activity and engagement in the sub
* Identify users who have posted or commented previously and have a history of relevant discussions
* Provide personalized feedback and suggestions to users on how to improve their chances of getting approved
* Automate the approval process for users who meet the new rules and requirements

**Step 3:** Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze user engagement and behavior in the sub. The algorithms will be trained on historical data to identify patterns and trends in user activity, allowing the AI chatbot to provide more accurate and personalized feedback to users.

**Timeline:**

* Development of the AI chatbot: 2 weeks
* Integration with moderation tools and creation of the automated workflow: 3 weeks
* Training of machine learning algorithms: 2 weeks
* Testing and deployment: 2 weeks

**Solution Map:**

1. Develop AI chatbot
2. Integrate chatbot with moderation tools
3. Create automated workflow using Make.com
4. Train machine learning algorithms
5. Test and deploy the solution
6. Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the solution

### Post Content:
Hey r/tax, I'm a relatively new mod to this group in the last 3-6 months, looks like the long time mod quakerots left a few months back and quite a few of the AutoMod actions are outdated from the pandemic, so I'm looking at updating the rules and AutoMod commenting and would like to get feedback from subreddit users

As a reference, [here's the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/3zf1bs/before_you_post_see_if_you_can_find_your_answer/) that used to be pinned with a bunch of the IRS links, unfortunately I don't think people in general tend to look at pinned posts if they're looking to get a specific question answered

**AMA Announcement**: There will be an [AMA on Feb 12th with USAToday](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1anizkt/upcoming_usa_today_ama_feb_12th_noon_to_3_pm_et/) personal finance team 12-3pm ET

## Rules

### [Current Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/about/rules/)

They're pretty simple - be nice, don't solicit business, no self promotion

### New Rules

No AI generated comments/content - it's low quality, and we're not here to be AI fact checkers

No discussion of tax fraud - openly suggesting/supporting tax fraud calls into question the reliability of the comments here, of course people should always take reddit advice with a grain of salt, but suggesting fraud on top of that just degrades the subreddit

**Anything else specific that frequent subreddit users would like to see added?**

## AutoMod Commenter

I've removed all the oudated auto-comments/removal, here are the new ones I'm thinking of adding - note that these would just be an FYI comment on the post, the post itself would not be removed, just saves frequent users the effort of linking the same things or re-iterating the frequently asked questions around this time of year

 -  **Explaining how tax brackets work** - users could comment "!ELI5taxes", AutoMod would reply with a breakdown that's frequently repeated here - if someone has a preferred example they've seen here please link it in the comments

 -  **Explaining how tax refund works** - users could comment "!ELI5refund", AutoMod would reply with the paying cash at the grocery store example plus explaining lower refund vs lower paychecks

 -  **Return vs refund** - I've seen this one frequently mentioned as an AutoMod request, but I suspect figuring out the right regex trigger would be tricky as I wouldn't want it to just be blindly commented on every single post mentioning a tax return or refund

 -  **IRS withholding estimator** - [links to tool](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) for updating W4(s) with summary of frequent mistakes like double counting dependents for married couples or not properly accounting for multiple jobs

 -  **Dependents** - links to [IRS dependent tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/whom-may-i-claim-as-a-dependent), if someone wants to draft a summary with it then you're welcome to comment it here, just not sure if that's necessary as it could get lengthy 

 -  **Do I have to file** - link to [IRS tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return) plus summary

 -  **Others** - wishlist that may be helpful, but not sure if these are really needed/not sure of regex trigger

  - $600 threshold for 1099-K

  - Do I have to include x income?

  - How do I report income without a 1099/Do I have to? (similar to previous)

  - When will I get my refund?

 - 1099 vs W2 misclassification

 - Can I claim x if I work from home? (Think these have mostly died down the last 1-2 years)

**Open to any reasonable/genuine feedback on these from frequent users of the subreddit**

## Solution Plan for 2024-08-11

### Post Content:
I just got a notice from the IRS that in 2022 I did not report a 1099 form for the withdrawal I made from my 401k for the down payment on our first home. For some reason I thought the taxes were withheld when I made the withdrawal. I think in the chaos of it all I just lost sight of it. 

Anyways, here I am, two years later receiving notice that I owed $10K in taxes, paid $3K, throw in a $1,400 understatement penalty and nearly $1K in interest, bringing my total amount due by September 4 to $9433. 

I have no idea what to do here. Obviously I don’t have $9k to throw at this and call it a day. Where do I go from here? 


### URL:

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The pain point is the unexpected tax liability and penalties resulting from the failure to report a 401k withdrawal. The solution plan aims to address the issue by:

1. Verifying the accuracy of the tax liability: The individual should obtain a copy of the 1099-R form and review it to ensure that any tax withholding is accurately reflected.
2. Requesting a payment plan: The individual can contact the IRS to set up a payment plan, which can be done online or by phone. The IRS will consider the individual's financial situation and allow a payment plan with interest and fees or a shorter-term plan with only a fee.
3. Potential abatement of penalties: If the individual has paid taxes timely in previous years, they may be eligible for a first-time abatement of the underpayment penalty.
4. Filing an amended return: To report the income from the 401k withdrawal, the individual should file an amended return (Form 1040-X) and claim the exemption for home purchase, which may reduce the penalties.
5. Seeking professional help: If the individual is unsure about the process or needs guidance, they can consult a CPA or tax lawyer to ensure they are taking the correct steps to address the tax liability.

**Timeline:**

* Step 1: Verify the accuracy of the tax liability - 1-2 days
* Step 2: Request a payment plan - 1-2 days
* Step 3: Potential abatement of penalties - 2-4 weeks
* Step 4: Filing an amended return - 2-4 weeks
* Step 5: Seeking professional help - ongoing

**Solution Map:**

1. Obtain a copy of the 1099-R form and review it to ensure accuracy.
2. Contact the IRS to set up a payment plan.
3. Research and apply for a first-time abatement of the underpayment penalty (if eligible).
4. File an amended return (Form 1040-X) and claim the exemption for home purchase.
5. Consult a CPA or tax lawyer to ensure the correct steps are taken to address the tax liability.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Keep detailed records of all correspondence and payments made to the IRS.
* Consider setting up automatic payments to ensure timely payments.
* Review and understand the terms of the payment plan and any penalties or interest associated with it.
* Consider seeking professional help from a CPA or tax lawyer to ensure the individual is taking the correct steps to address the tax liability.

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The pain point in this case is the unexpected notice from the IRS regarding the unreported 1099 form and the resulting penalties and interest. To address this, we can use the mentioned technologies in the following way:

1. AI Agents: We can deploy an AI agent to analyze the situation and provide personalized recommendations for the taxpayer. The AI agent can also assist in communicating with the IRS on behalf of the taxpayer.
2. Large Language Models (LLMs): We can use an LLM to generate a detailed report on the taxpayer's situation, including the 1099 form, tax withholding, and any applicable penalties and interest. This report can be used to support the taxpayer's case and provide evidence of their efforts to comply with tax laws.
3. Automation platforms like Make.com: We can use an automation platform to streamline the process of communicating with the IRS, submitting payments, and requesting payment plans. This can help reduce the stress and complexity of dealing with the IRS.
4. Machine Learning: We can use machine learning algorithms to analyze the taxpayer's financial situation and provide recommendations for payment plans and other tax-related strategies.

**Timeline:**

The timeline for implementing this solution plan is as follows:

1. Day 1-3: Analyze the situation and generate a report using AI agents and LLMs.
2. Day 4-7: Submit the report and any supporting documentation to the IRS and request a payment plan.
3. Day 8-14: Set up a payment plan with the IRS and make the first payment.
4. Day 15-28: Continue making payments and communicate with the IRS as necessary.
5. Day 30+: Monitor the situation and adjust the payment plan as needed.

**Solution Map:**

The sequence of steps to achieve the solution is as follows:

1. Gather relevant documents, including the 1099 form and any supporting documentation.
2. Analyze the situation using AI agents and LLMs to generate a detailed report.
3. Submit the report and any supporting documentation to the IRS and request a payment plan.
4. Set up a payment plan with the IRS and make the first payment.
5. Continue making payments and communicate with the IRS as necessary.
6. Monitor the situation and adjust the payment plan as needed.
7. Consider seeking the advice of a tax professional or financial advisor to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.

**Additional Recommendations:**

Based on the comments provided, the following additional recommendations can be made:

* Check the Form 1099-R for tax withholding and ensure that it is counted as taxes paid.
* Consider requesting a first-time abatement for the underpayment penalty if the taxpayer has no history of tax payment issues.
* Make a payment plan with the IRS and set up automatic payments to ensure timely payments.
* Consider seeking the advice of a tax professional or financial advisor to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.
* Keep detailed records of all communications with the IRS and any supporting documentation to ensure that the taxpayer's case is properly documented.
* Consider submitting a hardship withdrawal request for the purchase of a primary residence if the 401(k) plan allows it.
