It still made it uncomfortable.  It felt like I was a teacher at a party for teenagers - I was so self conscious of everything I said and did.  Did I appear intelligent?  Was I oversharing?

      "Page Content: Maybe I have some social anxiety, but I am always wary when I'm at a social event and clients who use my tax practice appear.  This happened during 2023, when I joined a neighborhood card group.  I walked up to the front door, entered with my hors d'oeuvres and stepped into the living room.  There, in a pile of cushions, sat two of my biggest tax clients.  I knew how much they made - and it was about 20 times what I did.  It felt a bit intimidating, seeing them there.  In addition, I had just corrected a major screw up of a past tax practitioner for them, and they brought it up, right there in the party!    \n",
      "\n",
      "My heart began to pound, *I didn't want anyone to bring up tax issues, or mention my business at all.*  We live in a relatively affluent area, and most of our clientele come right out of our children's school district zone, so it was only natural that I'd run into clients through social events.  It still made it uncomfortable.  It felt like I was a teacher at a party for teenagers - I was so self conscious of everything I said and did.  Did I appear intelligent?  Was I oversharing?  Lots of drinking occurs at these card game events, which happen on the regular.  I'm always on guard, analyzing my behavior.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward over a year and a half later - now almost the entire card group members are my clients.  As of today, I've never disclosed the status of our business relationships.  I think what bothers me the most is that I know all the financial details of my friend group.  And we are officially friends now - but I can't mention in front of Tom and Jerry that I also prepare Homer and Marge's return, Dick and Jane's return etc.  Occasionally, tax or income issues have been lightly mentioned in the group and I visibly blush and stammer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The final straw happened this tax season, when one of my favorite friends in the group asked if I could take on her and her husband's tax return, and I told her I wasn't taking on any new clientele, even for her, so that she might go and find someone else that season.  I'm pretty sure she'd be pissed if she learned I was already working with *literally every one in our friend group - but not her*.  \n",
