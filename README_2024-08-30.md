## Solution Plan for 2024-08-30

### Post Content:
Hello! Even though there is a nationwide shortage of accountants, interest in this sub is at an all-time high. If you're new here, some reminders:

**1) This sub is for those in the tax preparation profession only.**  
This doesn't mean you have to have a CPA or EA, or be the direct tax preparer. Anyone working for a tax preparation firm/office can be part of this sub. That means the IT person, the front desk, the firm admin, etc.

**2) This is a restricted sub.**  
That means you must be approved to post here. With the flood here in the last couple of weeks of folks wanting to become approved users, here's a new rule, at least for tax season: ***You must have some post or comment history in this sub in order to be approved.*** This will help indicate you're not going to post about 'why my tax return hasn't deposited yet', or whether you should be an 'LLC' in order to get 'tax heavens'.

**3) Adhere to sub rules.**  
Basically, have User Flair set and stay on-topic and don't be a jerk. Tax questions (not pertaining to recent rules) should go in r/tax or r/technicaltax. This is more about software, IRS/state agency issues, etc. If you can't find the right flair for your post, double-check that it is an appropriate topic for this post.

**4) Good luck this year!**  
It's a leap year, so even though the tax deadline falls on Apr 15, we technically get an extra day.

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The main pain point discussed in this Reddit post and comments is the restriction on posting for new users without a post or comment history in the sub. The solution plan will focus on implementing an AI-powered approval process to streamline the approval of new users.

**Step 1: AI-Powered Approval Process**

Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the user's post or comment history within the sub. The LLM will identify patterns and trends in their engagement, such as the frequency and quality of their posts, to determine their level of involvement and expertise in the tax preparation profession.

**Step 2: Customized Approval Form**

Create a customized approval form using Make.com's automation platform. This form will ask new users to provide information about their experience and qualifications in the tax preparation profession. The form will also include a section for users to provide a brief introduction about themselves and their experience.

**Step 3: Machine Learning Algorithm**

Develop a machine learning algorithm that will analyze the user's answers to the approval form and their post or comment history. The algorithm will evaluate the user's answers based on a set of predefined criteria, such as their experience, qualifications, and engagement within the sub.

**Step 4: Automated Approval**

Once the user's application is reviewed and approved by the algorithm, the system will automatically grant them posting privileges within the sub.

**Timeline:**

* Development of AI-powered approval process: 2 weeks
* Customized approval form creation: 1 week
* Machine learning algorithm development: 3 weeks
* Testing and implementation: 2 weeks
* Total estimated timeline: 8 weeks

**Solution Map:**

1. Identify and analyze user's post or comment history within the sub using LLM.
2. Create a customized approval form using Make.com's automation platform.
3. Develop a machine learning algorithm to evaluate user's answers and post or comment history.
4. Test and refine the algorithm.
5. Implement the automated approval process.
6. Grant posting privileges to approved users.

By implementing this solution plan, the subreddit can streamline the approval process for new users, ensuring that only qualified and engaged users can post within the sub.

I'm just seeing how other tax pros deal with this as I'm sure it's pretty common. 

But often times clients, usually business owners, get hit with their high tax bill because they don't pay their estimated taxes, and they want to know what deductions they should be doing. 



I always say maxing out retirement and HSA are good ideas. They also need to pay their estimated taxes. But often times they just propose they should just buy a new vehicle or some other large business expense so they have more deductions.

I always say if you need to do that, then do it, but often times if your goal is to just pay less taxes it's better to just pay the tax bill as it'll be more money out of your pocket if for example you pay for a new vehicle and your taxes on top of that. 

Is that the right approach, or is there a better way to advise clients during these situations?

Hi r/tax community,

We appreciate and encourage thoughtful discussions on tax policy and related topics. However, we need to address a recurring issue.

Recently, there have been several comments suggesting that "taxes are voluntary" or claiming that there is no legal requirement to pay taxes. While we welcome diverse perspectives on tax policies, promoting such statements is not only misleading but also illegal. This subreddit does not support or condone the promotion of illegal activities.

To clarify:

* **Tax Policy Discussion:** Constructive conversations about tax laws, policies, reforms, and their implications.
* **Illegal Promotion:** Claims or suggestions that paying taxes is voluntary or that there is no legal obligation to do so.

If a comment promotes illegal activities, our practice is to delete it and consider banning the user, either temporarily or permanently, based on their comment history.

This policy is in place to ensure that our subreddit remains a reliable and law-abiding resource for all members. We've had several inquiries about this topic recently, so we hope this post provides the necessary clarification.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

* r/tax Mod Team

### Post Content:
We have a rental property under an LLC. In past years our tax accountant correctly had 100% for "Business Allocation Percentage" in <censored state's> Income Tax Returns, and federal Schedule K-1.

This year i noticed it showed 66%, ie each location that used to show 100%, now showed -34% year-over-year difference. I asked to change back to 100%, but they said the software is buggy and it doesn't matter if it's 66%, or 100%, and they're refusing to change it.

What are the repercussions if it's incorrectly 66 instead of 100? Does it matter if this number isn't accurate?

I haven't found anything online despite many searches.

My gut says Yes, it matters -- the return should be accurate and this could bite us down the line.

Edit per one of the comments: This property is not in our home state.

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**


The issue at hand is the incorrect "Business Allocation Percentage" in the LLC's income tax return, which has been reduced from 100% to 66%. This discrepancy has caused concerns about the accuracy of the return and potential repercussions. To address this pain point, I propose the following solution plan:


1. **Initial Investigation:** Request a detailed report from the accountant explaining the reason behind the change in the allocation percentage and the manual or automated process used to calculate it. This will help identify if the issue is due to software glitches or incorrect input.


2. **Review and Verification:** Carefully review the tax return and schedules to ensure that the income is accurately reported and reconciles with the financial statements. Verify the calculations and ensure that the 66% allocation percentage does not affect the total income reported.


3. **AI Agent Intervention:** Utilize an AI agent to analyze the tax return and identify any potential errors or discrepancies. The AI agent can also assist in identifying the correct allocation percentage and provide recommendations for correction.


4. **Automated Workflow:** Implement an automated workflow using a tool like Make.com to streamline the tax preparation process and reduce the likelihood of human error. This can include automated calculations, data entry, and reporting.


5. **Machine Learning:** Apply machine learning techniques to the tax preparation data to identify patterns and anomalies, which can help detect potential errors or discrepancies in the future.


**Timeline:**


The implementation of this solution plan will take approximately 4-6 weeks, depending on the complexity of the issue and the availability of the accountant and other stakeholders.


**Solution Map:**


1. Initial Investigation (1-2 days)
2. Review and Verification (2-3 days)
3. AI Agent Intervention (1-2 days)
4. Automated Workflow Implementation (1-2 weeks)
5. Machine Learning Application (1-2 weeks)
6. Review and Testing (1-2 days)


**Conclusion:** The proposed solution plan aims to address the issue of the incorrect "Business Allocation Percentage" in the LLC's income tax return. By conducting an initial investigation, reviewing and verifying the tax return, utilizing an AI agent, implementing an automated workflow, and applying machine learning techniques, we can ensure the accuracy of the return and reduce the risk of potential repercussions.
