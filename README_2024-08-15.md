## Solution Plan for 2024-08-15

### Post Content:
I've got a client who is sorting through an elderly parent's finances. There's an old Keogh that Fidelity has "no records" on other than the current balance. No contributions are being made, and they want to roll it into an IRA. The plan administrator (elderly parent) has dementia. Her original accountant is dead. No one has any records of the plan to fully fill out the 5500, because everyone currently able to do so had no involvement when the plan was active.

I'm unsure how to advise the client. They're not sure if any of the filings have been up to date.  
  
What can they do? Consult a CFP who works in elder planning who may have more experience with these things? Make an IRS appointment and hope for the best as they plead utter confusion to a clerk who won't know what's they're talking about? Grab a Ouija board and ask the original accountant for plan details from beyond?

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan**

The client is faced with an elderly parent's Keogh plan, which has "no records" with Fidelity, and the plan administrator (the elderly parent) has dementia, making it difficult to gather information. The client is unsure about the plan's compliance with filing requirements, specifically the 5500 filing. To address this pain point, I recommend the following:

1. **Consult a CFP with elder planning experience**: A Certified Financial Planner (CFP) with expertise in elder planning can provide guidance on how to navigate the situation. They can help the client gather information from available sources, assess the plan's compliance, and develop a plan to roll it into an IRA.
2. **Search for prior-year 5500 filings**: The US Department of Labor (DOL) website allows searching for prior-year 5500 filings by plan name or EIN. This may provide some insight into the plan's history and compliance status.
3. **Complete the 5500 filing**: If the client has a prior-year 5500 and no contributions or withdrawals were made, they can use the ending balance for each year to calculate the gain/loss for the year. This will help complete the filing.
4. **File for penalty relief**: If the client is filing a late 5500, they should go through the penalty relief program to limit the penalty to $1,500.

**Timeline**

* Consultation with CFP: 1-2 weeks
* Searching for prior-year 5500 filings: 1-2 weeks
* Completing and filing the 5500: 1-2 weeks
* Filing for penalty relief: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time: 6-12 weeks

**Solution Map**

1. Consult a CFP with elder planning experience
2. Search for prior-year 5500 filings on the US DOL website
3. Gather information from available sources and assess the plan's compliance
4. Develop a plan to roll the Keogh plan into an IRA
5. Complete the 5500 filing using the prior-year ending balances
6. File for penalty relief to limit the penalty to $1,500
7. Monitor the situation and adjust the plan as necessary

By following this solution plan, the client can navigate the complex situation and ensure compliance with filing requirements while also rolling the Keogh plan into an IRA.

I am curious what kind of fall busy season your firms have ahead of them. The firm I work for have 600 returns that need to filed, yet our tax managers are still reviewing returns from spring busy season. Small staff of 5 associates. Owner needs us all to work 6 Saturdays between now and Oct 15th. I personally feel the firm has taken on way too many clients for the amount of personnel they have. 

Anyone going to experience a fall busy season as insane as their spring?

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

Based on the Reddit post and comments, it appears that the firm is facing a busy season due to taking on too many clients with insufficient personnel. The owner is expecting the staff to work 6 Saturdays between now and October 15th. To address this pain point, I propose the following solution:

1. Implement AI-powered workflow automation: Utilize Make.com's automation platform to streamline the workflow and reduce manual labor. Create a workflow that assigns tasks to staff members based on their expertise and availability. This will help to distribute the workload more efficiently and reduce the need for overtime.
2. Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for document review: Utilize LLMs to assist in reviewing returns from the spring busy season. This will help to reduce the workload of the tax managers and free up more time for staff members to focus on new returns.
3. Implement machine learning-based forecasting: Use machine learning algorithms to forecast the workload and identify potential bottlenecks. This will enable the firm to proactively adjust its workflow and allocate resources more effectively.
4. Enhance client communication: Implement a system for clients to submit their information and documents electronically, reducing the need for manual data entry and minimizing the risk of delays.
5. Staff augmentation: Consider hiring temporary staff or freelancers to assist with the workload during the busy season. This will help to alleviate the pressure on the existing staff and ensure that all returns are completed on time.

**Timeline:**

* Week 1-2: Implement AI-powered workflow automation and LLM-assisted document review
* Week 3-4: Implement machine learning-based forecasting and enhance client communication
* Week 5-6: Hire temporary staff or freelancers to assist with the workload

**Solution Map:**

1. Identify tasks that can be automated using Make.com's automation platform

It is constantly touted how there’s a shortage of tax pros but there never seems to be a disclaimer “except for in Florida, except in Alabama, except in XYZ”. 

Is it truly that easy to set up shop in any metro area and just clean house? Perhaps I’m overly cynical but I feel like there must be some markets that are saturated or where fees are depressed. We are looking at several places to relocate to (DFW, Tampa/St. Pete & DC areas are the prospects at the moment) and we feel as if we should be factoring in the market as firm owners but if it’s just that easy with networking, reaching out to investment advisors, bookkeepers, lawyers, etc. then I guess we should just ignore that as an issue. 

(Of course we can transition with our existing clients but over time we would like to establish a client base in our local market.)

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The pain point discussed in the Reddit post and comments is the perceived ease of setting up a tax practice in any metro area and the potential saturation or depression of fees in certain markets. As a finance and tax AI assistant, I recommend the following solution plan:

1. Conduct Market Research: Use AI-powered tools to gather data on the tax market in the target areas (DFW, Tampa/St. Pete, and DC). Analyze factors such as the number of tax professionals, competition, fees, and client demand. This will help identify potential saturated markets and areas with growth opportunities.
2. Niche Identification: Utilize LLMs to identify niches in the tax industry that are underserved or have high demand. This could include specialized services like those mentioned in the comments, such as tax preparation for OnlyFans clients.
3. Virtual Practice Setup: Consider setting up a virtual practice to expand the reach and reduce costs. LLMs can help with client communication, bookkeeping, and tax preparation. This will also allow for a more flexible and remote work arrangement.
4. Networking and Partnerships: Use AI-powered tools to connect with investment advisors, bookkeepers, lawyers, and other professionals in the target areas. Build relationships and partnerships to expand the professional network and potential client base.
5. Targeted Marketing: Utilize automation platforms like Make.com to create targeted marketing campaigns, focusing on specific niches or markets. This will help attract clients who are more likely to require specialized tax services.
6. Fee Structure: Consider implementing a value-based fee structure that takes into account the complexity of the tax returns and the level of service provided. This will help differentiate the practice from competitors and attract clients who are willing to pay for high-quality services.

**Timeline:**

The implementation timeline will depend on the complexity of the market research, niche identification, and virtual practice setup. However, here is a rough estimate:

* Market research and niche identification: 2-4 weeks
* Virtual practice setup: 4-6 weeks
* Networking and partnerships: Ongoing, with regular check-ins and updates
* Targeted marketing campaigns: 2-4 weeks
* Fee structure implementation: 1-2 weeks

**Solution Map:**

1. Conduct market research and identify potential niches
2. Set up a virtual practice and establish a professional network
3. Identify and connect with potential clients and partners
4. Develop targeted marketing campaigns to attract clients
5. Implement a value-based fee structure
6. Monitor and adjust the practice as needed to ensure success

By following this solution plan, the firm owners can mitigate the risks of setting up a tax practice in a new area and increase their chances of success.

I'm just seeing what the right thing to do is in these situations. 

My most recent situation is not a new situation I've been in, and I'm sure we're all have the same experience. 

This client in particular I knew right from the beginning was probably going to be a headache client. But I took them on anyways. 

I've basically been doing all of their accounting work. Taxes, bookkeeping, payroll, etc. 

They are bad communicators, never give me what I requested, need their hands held 100% of the way, and are just overall bad clients. 

The problem we've been running into is their payroll. When I took them onboard I asked for all their payroll information. The information did not appear to be correct, so I pushed backed on it and they assured me it was the correct information. 

So I went forward with it. Fast forward a few months later, we started getting notices from the state saying they haven't received payroll tax filings. I have my client call the state and it turns out I was correct, so they got me the correct payroll account information. 

We later receive another notice for a different payroll tax that also wasn't filed. This number didn't look wrong, so I didn't question it, but it also was apparently incorrect. I sent lots of request to call the state so I can get the correct information. I sent multiple requests over 3 weeks, and I just kept getting "I'm working on it" responses. 

Eventually the time was come that I knew the problems were just going to get worse, so I decided to fire them. 

My question was, should I have stuck with them even though I knew they were going to be a problem, at least until I get their payroll under control? Or is there never a good time to fire clients, and I did the right thing?

Just trying to figure out how to handle this in the future as I'm sure I'll come accross this again.

## Solution Plan for 2024-08-15

### Post Content:
I will be a tax only firm (no payroll or bookkeeping) and will have about 80-100 clients for next tax season. I'm going through what I have already and what I plan to do and making sure I didn't miss anything.

**Tax Software -** CCH Axcess (this is what I've used for the last 8 years and it's just easier to stick with what I'm familiar with for now).

**Document Management -** CCH Axcess

**Client Portal -** CCH Axcess -- I don't love this but unless I can find a relatively cheap alternative, this is what I'll be using since I already paid for it.

\*\*\*It was cheaper to do the Quick Start package which included all the items listed above

**Firm Bookkeeping** - QuickBooks

**Payroll -** Come time, I plan to use Gusto. I will not have any employees my first year, just me.

Website is live, bank account is setup, legal paperwork done. I have my EFIN, email, phone, business cards... I'm waiting to purchase insurance since I'm not actually doing business yet.

Here is what I'm undecided on.....

**Payment Processing & Invoicing -** I am familiar with Square and like it but would be open to another option. I do not like QuickBooks invoicing whatsoever.

**E-Signatures -** Considering TaxDome so I can use it for signatures, engagement letters, etc., but it seems a little pricey. Wondering if DocuSign would be cheaper. I do like the idea of having a portal alternative to CCH Axcess' but I also want to be conservative with expenses.

I'm operating 100% remote for at least the first year, so I'm wondering if I should get a PO box for business mailings and for older clients who prefer to mail documents. My software is cloud based but should I look into some kind of IT network solutions/managed services? I currently use both Malwarebytes and McAfee (although I'm hearing McAfee is not the greatest?).

What am I missing? Any ideas on software I should look into? Thanks!

Hey fellow tax pros,

Old Man Full TAXPRO Curmudgeon here—I've been asked what I would tell my younger self. Well, this isn’t just for my younger self, but for everyone out there. I even forced my 17-year-old to watch this video below to understand his rights when he started to drive.

So to frame it for us TaxPros:

When dealing with the IRS, the Department of Revenues, Taxes and Equalization, and many other governmental organizations, they tell you to comply and hand over information, but that’s not always the best approach. Know your rights—especially the right to remain silent. Why? Because...

Over my years as a CPA, Fraud Examiner, and PI, one critical skill stands out: gathering evidence to prove your point or validate your deduction.  The same is true with audits and investigations.

Think of investigations like writing an essay: the thesis is your first paragraph- you are a bad guy, and the rest of the paper is written to prove that thesis.  
  
Unfortunately, investigator biases write the thesis first so they trap you to fill in the gaps to prove their case. One crucial aspect I’ve faced during audits is to get a lawyer and remain silent - let the Auditor's bias come out by the questions she asks and forces to ask - 

I recommend you watch this video "Don't Talk to the Police" by James Duane and share it with everyone, especially your clients if they get a letter from whoever to "Call" the Auditor.  

[Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE)

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

For the pain point discussed in the Reddit post and comments, I propose a solution plan that utilizes AI Agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), Automation platforms like Make.com, and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to educate taxpayers and tax professionals on their rights when dealing with governmental organizations and to provide a framework for effective communication during audits and investigations.

**Solution Plan:**

1. Develop an AI-powered chatbot, using an LLM, that provides a comprehensive guide on taxpayer rights and obligations. The chatbot will be accessible through a mobile app or a website, allowing taxpayers to access the information at their convenience.

2. Integrate the chatbot with an Automation platform like Make.com, which will enable the creation of a workflow that connects various apps and services. This will allow the chatbot to:

   a. Provide personalized recommendations for taxpayers, based on their specific situation and location.

   b. Offer templates for taxpayer responses to auditors or investigators, ensuring that taxpayers are aware of their rights and are equipped to respond effectively.

   c. Track and analyze taxpayer interactions with the chatbot, providing insights for tax professionals and policymakers to improve the overall taxpayer experience.

3. Use Machine Learning algorithms to analyze taxpayer interactions and identify patterns and trends. This will enable the development of predictive models that can:
   a. Identify high-risk taxpayers who may be more likely to encounter issues with audits or investigations.
   b. Provide personalized advice and guidance to taxpayers based on their specific situation and risk profile.

**Timeline:**

The implementation of the solution plan will be divided into three phases, with the following estimated timeline:

Phase 1: Development and Testing (3 months)

* Develop the AI-powered chatbot and integrate it with the Automation platform.
* Test the chatbot and workflow to ensure seamless functionality and accuracy.

Phase 2: Launch and Rollout (3 months)

* Launch the chatbot and make it accessible to taxpayers through a mobile app or website.
* Roll out the chatbot to a small group of taxpayers to gather feedback and refine the platform.

Phase 3: Expansion and Evaluation (6 months)

* Expand the chatbot to a larger group of taxpayers and continue to gather feedback and evaluate its effectiveness.
* Refine the Machine Learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of the chatbot's responses.

**Solution Map:**

The solution map will consist of the following steps:

1. Identify the pain point: Taxpayers and tax professionals are unaware of their rights and obligations when dealing with governmental organizations.

2. Develop the solution: Create an AI-powered chatbot that provides a comprehensive guide on taxpayer rights and obligations.

3. Integrate with Automation platform: Connect the chatbot with an Automation platform to enable personalized recommendations, templates for taxpayer responses, and tracking and analysis of taxpayer interactions.

4. Use Machine Learning algorithms: Analyze taxpayer interactions and identify patterns and trends to develop predictive models that can identify high-risk taxpayers and provide personalized advice.

5. Launch and roll out the solution: Launch the chatbot and make it accessible to taxpayers through a mobile app or website, and roll out the chatbot to a small group of taxpayers to gather feedback and refine the platform.

6. Evaluate and refine the solution: Continue to gather feedback and evaluate the effectiveness of the chatbot, refining the platform and Machine Learning algorithms as needed.

Hi All!

This community is fantastic so I first want to throw out a thank you to everyone.

I’m currently setting up my firm and working through all of my licensing, EFIN, software, etc setup. I think it will be August at the earliest before I am fully able to service clients legally.

What is the market like for CPA’s/tax preparers at this time of year? Should I be exclusively marketing myself for 2025? Are there folks lingering out there that still need 2024 returns done?

I assume the market for bookkeeping, business returns, etc is still around but I would think most 1040/1041 work is already out the door and filed. What is everyone’s experience with this?

### URL:

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The pain point discussed in the Reddit post is the uncertainty of the market for CPA's/tax preparers during the summer months, specifically around the time of year when most 1040/1041 work is already filed. The post also raises concerns about the feasibility of exclusively marketing oneself for 2025, given the potential for lingering clients who still need 2024 returns done.

To address this pain point, I propose the following solution plan:

1. Utilize AI Agents to analyze market trends and provide insights on the demand for tax preparation services during the summer months. This can be achieved by training an AI agent on a large dataset of tax preparation industry trends, including historical data on client demand and seasonal fluctuations.
2. Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to create targeted marketing campaigns that cater to the specific needs and concerns of potential clients. LLMs can be trained on a dataset of tax-related queries and responses to generate personalized marketing content that addresses the concerns of clients who still need 2024 returns done.
3. Implement an Automation platform like Make.com to streamline and automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry, accounting, and bookkeeping. This will free up time for the tax preparer to focus on high-value tasks, such as marketing and client acquisition.
4. Utilize Machine Learning algorithms to analyze client data and identify patterns and trends that can inform marketing and business development strategies. This can help the tax preparer identify potential clients who are likely to need tax preparation services during the summer months.

**Timeline:**

The implementation timeline for this solution plan will depend on the specific requirements and resources available. However, a rough estimate of the timeline could be as follows:

* Week 1-2: Analyze market trends using AI Agents and identify potential clients who still need 2024 returns done.
* Week 3-4: Create targeted marketing campaigns using Large Language Models and launch them on social media and email marketing channels.
* Week 5-8: Implement Automation platform and train AI Agents to automate repetitive tasks.
* Week 9-12: Analyze client data using Machine Learning algorithms and refine marketing and business development strategies.

**Solution Map:**

The sequence of steps to achieve the solution is as follows:

1. Analyze market trends using AI Agents to identify potential clients who still need 2024 returns done.
2. Create targeted marketing campaigns using Large Language Models and launch them on social media and email marketing channels.
3. Implement Automation platform to streamline and automate repetitive tasks.
4. Train AI Agents to automate tasks such as data entry, accounting, and bookkeeping.
5. Analyze client data using Machine Learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends that can inform marketing and business development strategies.
6. Refine marketing and business development strategies based on analysis of client data.
7. Focus on high-value tasks, such as marketing and client acquisition, and enjoy the luxury of building a practice that looks exactly like you want it without any pressure from deadlines or clients.

By following this solution plan, the tax preparer can effectively address the pain point of uncertainty in the market and position themselves for success in the summer months.

New client came to me to get their taxes done. Self employed with a rather large business. 

The trouble I'm running into is this guy is still keeping track of everything via spreadsheets. I'm not opposed to spreadsheets, but there's discrepancies all over the place, and they're pretty big ones. 

It wouldn't be too big of a deal if it was one or two, but it's many, and with it being a large business the data to go through is quite large. 

In a perfect world I'd like to tell this guy his business has outgrown the spreadsheets, and if he'd like my help he's going to have to pay to me to get him set up with Quickbooks and let me get all those transactions in there so everything is neat and clean. 

In the event he'd tell me to go pound sand, I'd like to just tell him he'll have to find a new accountant because I'm not interested in going through all this spreadsheet data.

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan**

The pain point being discussed is the difficulty in working with a self-employed client who still uses spreadsheets to track their business finances, resulting in discrepancies and inaccuracies. The accountant is considering telling the client that their business has outgrown spreadsheets and that they need to switch to a more advanced accounting software, such as QuickBooks. However, the client may refuse to make the change, which could lead to a breakdown in the working relationship.

**AI Agent Solution**

To address this pain point, an AI agent can be used to assist the accountant in communicating with the client and providing a solution. The AI agent can be trained to:

1. Analyze the client's financial data and identify potential discrepancies and inaccuracies.
2. Provide a report to the client highlighting the issues with their current spreadsheet-based system and the benefits of switching to a more advanced accounting software.
3. Offer to help the client transition to QuickBooks or another accounting software, including setting up the software and training the client on its use.

**Large Language Model (LLM) Solution**

An LLM can be used to generate a customized report for the client, highlighting the benefits of switching to QuickBooks or another accounting software. The report can be tailored to the client's specific needs and financial situation, and can provide a detailed analysis of the potential savings and benefits of making the switch.

### Post Content:
My business partner is a CPA who runs a tax practice. 400-500 personal returns, handful of businesses, a few trusts. He's looking to sell and retire.

I've heard from a couple other practices in my area that they're having problems with finding staff (nothing new, but it's worse than ever). Many firms already have more work than they can handle and they don't have capacity to absorb 400+ new clients. I heard of one guy who just closed his doors and walked away because he couldn't find a buyer.

Is this the kind of market you're seeing right now? (I'm in a suburb of a major city.) Instead of finding other practices to merge with, should we be looking for someone who doesn't own their own practice yet? If so, how do we find that person, LinkedIn?

Edit: I'm asking about the market, not seeking snide comments about corporate vs individual-heavy practices.

### Post Content:
I've got a client who is sorting through an elderly parent's finances. There's an old Keogh that Fidelity has "no records" on other than the current balance. No contributions are being made, and they want to roll it into an IRA. The plan administrator (elderly parent) has dementia. Her original accountant is dead. No one has any records of the plan to fully fill out the 5500, because everyone currently able to do so had no involvement when the plan was active.

I'm unsure how to advise the client. They're not sure if any of the filings have been up to date.  
  
What can they do? Consult a CFP who works in elder planning who may have more experience with these things? Make an IRS appointment and hope for the best as they plead utter confusion to a clerk who won't know what's they're talking about? Grab a Ouija board and ask the original accountant for plan details from beyond?

### URL:
https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/1eqo81o/any_experience_with_form_5500_but_theres_no/

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

To address the pain point of an elderly client with an old Keogh plan and limited documentation, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Consult a CFP with elder planning experience**: As suggested in the Reddit comments, a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) with expertise in elder planning can provide guidance on how to navigate the situation. They can help the client determine the best course of action for rolling over the Keogh plan into an IRA.
2. **Search for prior 5500 filings on the US DOL website**: As mentioned in the comments, the Department of Labor (DOL) website allows users to search for and view prior 5500 filings by plan name or Employer Identification Number (EIN). If the client can find the prior filings, it may provide the necessary information to complete the current 5500.
3. **Contact Fidelity to request additional information**: Although Fidelity has "no records" on the Keogh plan, the client may want to contact Fidelity again to request any available information, such as the plan's original documents or any existing records.
4. **File for penalty relief**: If the client is unable to complete the 5500 on time, they can file for penalty relief with the IRS to limit the penalty to $1,500.

**Timeline:**

* Day 1-2: Consult with a CFP with elder planning experience to determine the best course of action.
* Day 3-5: Search for prior 5500 filings on the US DOL website and contact Fidelity to request additional information.
* Day 6-10: Complete the 5500 and file for penalty relief, if necessary.
* Day 11-14: Roll over the Keogh plan into an IRA.

**Solution Map:**

Step 1: Consult with a CFP with elder planning experience
	* Identify the best course of action for rolling over the Keogh plan into an IRA
	* Determine the necessary documentation and information required for the rollover

Step 2: Search for prior 5500 filings on the US DOL website
	* Use the plan name or EIN to search for prior 5500 filings
	* Review and gather any available information

Step 3: Contact Fidelity to request additional information
	* Request any available information, such as the plan's original documents or existing records
	* Provide any necessary information to complete the 5500

Step 4: File for penalty relief (if necessary)
	* Determine if penalty relief is necessary due to late filing
	* Complete and submit the penalty relief application

Step 5: Roll over the Keogh plan into an IRA
	* Complete the necessary paperwork and documentation for the rollover
	* Submit the rollover application to the IRA provider

By following these steps and using the mentioned technologies, the client can navigate the complex process of rolling over an old Keogh plan into an IRA and minimize potential penalties.

I am curious what kind of fall busy season your firms have ahead of them. The firm I work for have 600 returns that need to filed, yet our tax managers are still reviewing returns from spring busy season. Small staff of 5 associates. Owner needs us all to work 6 Saturdays between now and Oct 15th. I personally feel the firm has taken on way too many clients for the amount of personnel they have. 

Anyone going to experience a fall busy season as insane as their spring?

It is constantly touted how there’s a shortage of tax pros but there never seems to be a disclaimer “except for in Florida, except in Alabama, except in XYZ”. 

Is it truly that easy to set up shop in any metro area and just clean house? Perhaps I’m overly cynical but I feel like there must be some markets that are saturated or where fees are depressed. We are looking at several places to relocate to (DFW, Tampa/St. Pete & DC areas are the prospects at the moment) and we feel as if we should be factoring in the market as firm owners but if it’s just that easy with networking, reaching out to investment advisors, bookkeepers, lawyers, etc. then I guess we should just ignore that as an issue. 

(Of course we can transition with our existing clients but over time we would like to establish a client base in our local market.)

I'm just seeing what the right thing to do is in these situations. 

My most recent situation is not a new situation I've been in, and I'm sure we're all have the same experience. 

This client in particular I knew right from the beginning was probably going to be a headache client. But I took them on anyways. 

I've basically been doing all of their accounting work. Taxes, bookkeeping, payroll, etc. 

They are bad communicators, never give me what I requested, need their hands held 100% of the way, and are just overall bad clients. 

The problem we've been running into is their payroll. When I took them onboard I asked for all their payroll information. The information did not appear to be correct, so I pushed backed on it and they assured me it was the correct information. 

So I went forward with it. Fast forward a few months later, we started getting notices from the state saying they haven't received payroll tax filings. I have my client call the state and it turns out I was correct, so they got me the correct payroll account information. 

We later receive another notice for a different payroll tax that also wasn't filed. This number didn't look wrong, so I didn't question it, but it also was apparently incorrect. I sent lots of request to call the state so I can get the correct information. I sent multiple requests over 3 weeks, and I just kept getting "I'm working on it" responses. 

Eventually the time was come that I knew the problems were just going to get worse, so I decided to fire them. 

My question was, should I have stuck with them even though I knew they were going to be a problem, at least until I get their payroll under control? Or is there never a good time to fire clients, and I did the right thing?

Just trying to figure out how to handle this in the future as I'm sure I'll come accross this again.

### URL:

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan**

The pain point discussed in the Reddit post and comments is related to managing difficult clients, specifically those who are poor communicators, demanding, and difficult to work with. The client in question has been causing headaches with their payroll, leading to non-filing of taxes, and the accountant is considering whether they should have stuck with the client until the payroll issues were resolved.

To address this pain point, I propose the following solution using AI Agents, Large Language Models, Automation platforms like Make.com, and Machine Learning:

1. **AI-powered Client Onboarding**: Implement an AI-powered client onboarding process that includes a thorough questionnaire to identify potential red flags, such as poor communication habits, unrealistic expectations, or lack of organization. This will help the accountant make more informed decisions about taking on new clients.
2. **Automated Communication Tools**: Utilize automation platforms like Make.com to create custom workflows that streamline communication with clients. This can include automated reminders, notifications, and follow-ups to ensure that clients are providing necessary information and meeting deadlines.
3. **Large Language Model-powered Reporting**: Leverage Large Language Models to generate detailed reports on client performance and behavior. This will help the accountant identify patterns and trends in client behavior, allowing them to make more informed decisions about which clients to keep or fire.
4. **Machine Learning-based Predictive Analytics**: Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze client data and predict the likelihood of a client becoming difficult or problematic. This will enable the accountant to make proactive decisions about which clients to prioritize and which to let go.
5. **AI-powered Client Escalation**: Implement an AI-powered client escalation process that automatically routes complex or difficult client issues to a designated team or expert. This will ensure that the accountant has the support they need to manage challenging clients effectively.

**Timeline**

The implementation timeline for this solution plan will depend on the complexity of the AI Agents, Large Language Models, and Automation platforms used. However, here is a rough estimate of the timeline:

* AI-powered Client Onboarding: 2 weeks
* Automated Communication Tools: 3 weeks
* Large Language Model-powered Reporting: 4 weeks
* Machine Learning-based Predictive Analytics: 6 weeks
* AI-powered Client Escalation: 5 weeks

**Solution Map**

1. Identify potential red flags during client onboarding using AI Agents (1-2 weeks)
2. Implement automated communication tools using Make.com (2-3 weeks)
3. Generate detailed reports on client performance using Large Language Models (3-4 weeks)
4. Analyze client data using machine learning algorithms to predict potential issues (4-6 weeks)
5. Implement AI-powered client escalation process (5-6 weeks)
6. Monitor and refine the solution plan based on client feedback and performance data (Ongoing)

By implementing this solution plan, accountants can better manage difficult clients, reduce stress and frustration, and focus on providing high-quality services to their clients.

I will be a tax only firm (no payroll or bookkeeping) and will have about 80-100 clients for next tax season. I'm going through what I have already and what I plan to do and making sure I didn't miss anything.

**Tax Software -** CCH Axcess (this is what I've used for the last 8 years and it's just easier to stick with what I'm familiar with for now).

**Document Management -** CCH Axcess

**Client Portal -** CCH Axcess -- I don't love this but unless I can find a relatively cheap alternative, this is what I'll be using since I already paid for it.

\*\*\*It was cheaper to do the Quick Start package which included all the items listed above

**Firm Bookkeeping** - QuickBooks

**Payroll -** Come time, I plan to use Gusto. I will not have any employees my first year, just me.

Website is live, bank account is setup, legal paperwork done. I have my EFIN, email, phone, business cards... I'm waiting to purchase insurance since I'm not actually doing business yet.

Here is what I'm undecided on.....

**Payment Processing & Invoicing -** I am familiar with Square and like it but would be open to another option. I do not like QuickBooks invoicing whatsoever.

**E-Signatures -** Considering TaxDome so I can use it for signatures, engagement letters, etc., but it seems a little pricey. Wondering if DocuSign would be cheaper. I do like the idea of having a portal alternative to CCH Axcess' but I also want to be conservative with expenses.

I'm operating 100% remote for at least the first year, so I'm wondering if I should get a PO box for business mailings and for older clients who prefer to mail documents. My software is cloud based but should I look into some kind of IT network solutions/managed services? I currently use both Malwarebytes and McAfee (although I'm hearing McAfee is not the greatest?).

What am I missing? Any ideas on software I should look into? Thanks!

## Solution Plan for 2024-08-15

### Post Content:
After two years of running my practice from my basement, I am starting to think about using a different address for all my business documents and engagement letters. For example, when creating an LLC for a client where I am the registered agent, you are not allowed to use a PO BOX so I use my home address. What do you guys recommend to keep your home address not involved with your business?

Hi All!

This community is fantastic so I first want to throw out a thank you to everyone.

I’m currently setting up my firm and working through all of my licensing, EFIN, software, etc setup. I think it will be August at the earliest before I am fully able to service clients legally.

What is the market like for CPA’s/tax preparers at this time of year? Should I be exclusively marketing myself for 2025? Are there folks lingering out there that still need 2024 returns done?

I assume the market for bookkeeping, business returns, etc is still around but I would think most 1040/1041 work is already out the door and filed. What is everyone’s experience with this?

New client came to me to get their taxes done. Self employed with a rather large business. 

The trouble I'm running into is this guy is still keeping track of everything via spreadsheets. I'm not opposed to spreadsheets, but there's discrepancies all over the place, and they're pretty big ones. 

It wouldn't be too big of a deal if it was one or two, but it's many, and with it being a large business the data to go through is quite large. 

In a perfect world I'd like to tell this guy his business has outgrown the spreadsheets, and if he'd like my help he's going to have to pay to me to get him set up with Quickbooks and let me get all those transactions in there so everything is neat and clean. 

In the event he'd tell me to go pound sand, I'd like to just tell him he'll have to find a new accountant because I'm not interested in going through all this spreadsheet data.

### URL:
https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/1e1ownf/is_it_fine_to_tell_a_client_to_do_it_my_way_or/

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The pain point being discussed is the use of spreadsheets by a self-employed business owner, which is causing discrepancies and making it difficult for the accountant to complete the taxes accurately. The accountant is considering telling the client that their business has outgrown the spreadsheets and needs to be set up with QuickBooks or another accounting software.

**Timeline:**

* Day 1-2: Discuss the issue with the client and explain the benefits of using QuickBooks or another accounting software.
* Day 3-5: Offer to help the client set up QuickBooks or another accounting software, and provide training on how to use it.
* Day 6-10: Review the client's financial records and reconcile any discrepancies that arise from the transition to the new accounting software.
* Day 11-15: Complete the client's taxes using the new accounting software.

**Solution Map:**

1. Identify the client's current accounting system and assess its limitations.
2. Discuss the benefits of using QuickBooks or another accounting software with the client and explain how it can help to improve accuracy and efficiency.
3. Offer to help the client set up QuickBooks or another accounting software, and provide training on how to use it.
4. Review the client's financial records and reconcile any discrepancies that arise from the transition to the new accounting software.
5. Complete the client's taxes using the new accounting software.
6. Monitor the client's accounting system and provide ongoing support to ensure that it remains accurate and efficient.

**Technologies Used:**

* AI Agents: None
* Large Language Models (LLMs): None
* Automation platforms like Make.com: None
* Machine Learning: None

**Alternative Solution:**

If the client is unwilling to switch to QuickBooks or another accounting software, the accountant could consider using a template or a ledger system in Excel to summarize the client's financial records. This would allow the accountant to review the client's financial records and reconcile any discrepancies without having to use the client's current accounting system.

**Additional Comments:**

* The accountant should consider having a clear conversation with the client about the limitations of spreadsheets and the benefits of using QuickBooks or another accounting software.
* The accountant should also be prepared to provide ongoing support to the client to ensure that they are able to use the new accounting software effectively.
* The accountant could also consider offering a discounted rate for clients who are willing to switch to QuickBooks or another accounting software.

I’ve been an enrolled agent for about 2.5 years now. I mostly work in audit/notice representation, but I do have a bit of experience with tax preparation. My employer allows us to have our own tax prep business, as long as we don’t interfere with or recruit the firm’s clients.

I’d like to know what the average startup cost in our field is for remote tax preparers, including E&O, cybersecurity, tax prep software, etc. Just a rough estimate is fine.

Thanks!

### URL:

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

For a remote tax preparer, the estimated startup costs can vary greatly depending on the level of investment in technology, marketing, and insurance. Based on the Reddit comments, here's a breakdown of the estimated costs:

1. Tax preparation software:
	* QuickBooks Desktop: $499
	* UltraTax Express250: $2,650
	* Drake: $400 (for 10 returns)
2. E&O (Errors and Omissions) insurance:
	* CAMICO E&O + Cyber: $452
	* E&O: $50/month (quoted separately)
3. Cyber insurance:
	* $950/year
4. Research tools and software:
	* Checkpoint subscription: $2,900
	* QuickFinder: $101
	* PlannerCS: $1,248
	* TaxDome: $600
5. Website and hosting:
	* Website build and hosting: $5,900 + $50/month
6. Marketing and advertising:
	* Calendly: $15/month
	* Microsoft: $22/month
	* Adobe: $13/month
7. Office and miscellaneous:
	* Laptop, monitors, and computer accessories: $2,800
	* PO Box: $165
	* Letterhead, business, and thank you cards: $835

Total estimated startup costs: $19,000

However, as mentioned in the comments, these costs can be reduced by:

* Building a simple website on Google Sites (free) and buying a domain for $12/year
* Using tax software that offers pay-per-return pricing
* Minimizing software costs
* Using existing technology, such as a computer and phone
* Being mindful of variable costs in a service-based business

**Timeline:**

The timeline for implementing the solution plan will depend on the remote tax preparer's goals and pace of setup. However, assuming a moderate pace, the following timeline can be estimated:

1. Research and planning: 1-2 weeks
2. Setting up office and technology: 2-4 weeks
3. Building website and marketing materials: 4-8 weeks
4. Launching the business: 8-12 weeks

**Solution Map:**

I know there are some old pros on this sub. I don't take my criticism of older clients lightly and I didn't post this to make you mad. But older clients are getting worse. They bitch about everything from their taxes to the bill I sent them, and think they are entitled to things that my other clients don't like special phone calls and hand holding.  So, please don't take offense to this one.

Clients are 74 years old.  Today I got an email from them. They said they are frustrated that I haven't provided them with any tax savings strategies, and they think they are paying too much in taxes.

Here are their sources of income/AGI/taxes:  

* Interest income
* Dividend income
* IRAs
* Pensions
* Social security
* AGI of $96K
* Taxes of $6,700

I wrote back and here was my advice:

* Stop putting your cash in CD's & interest-bearing accounts. Instead, invest in municipal bonds or noninterest-bearing accounts. CD's and interest-bearing accounts just generate taxable income.
* Invest in blue-chip growth stocks and get your investments out of dividend paying securities. They just generate taxable income.
* Only take your RMD's. Don't take anything more than your RMD's as every penny gets taxed. Or better yet, convert all of your IRAs to Roth IRAs and you only have to pay taxes once. You can avoid taxes on all of your future distributions. 
* Ask your former employer if they have a one-time lump-sum payout on your pension. That way you only get hit with taxes once and you can put the rest in the above tax-managed investment choices.
* You are welcomed to call the Social Security Administration and tell them to stop paying your benefits. 85% of them are getting taxed anyway.
* You are taking the standard deduction which was $30,700 in 2023. You are welcomed to give $35K or more to charity in 2024 to reduce your taxable income more than the standard deduction. 

All of my advice was tongue-in-cheek. He emailed back and said "But we need all of that income to live on and we cannot afford to give anything to charity. 

I replied again and said, "Then stop whining about your taxes. You paid an effective rate of 7% last year and earned almost $100K playing golf 3 days per week."

I am pretty sure they won't be back in February.

Hey r/tax, I'm a relatively new mod to this group in the last 3-6 months, looks like the long time mod quakerots left a few months back and quite a few of the AutoMod actions are outdated from the pandemic, so I'm looking at updating the rules and AutoMod commenting and would like to get feedback from subreddit users

As a reference, [here's the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/3zf1bs/before_you_post_see_if_you_can_find_your_answer/) that used to be pinned with a bunch of the IRS links, unfortunately I don't think people in general tend to look at pinned posts if they're looking to get a specific question answered

**AMA Announcement**: There will be an [AMA on Feb 12th with USAToday](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1anizkt/upcoming_usa_today_ama_feb_12th_noon_to_3_pm_et/) personal finance team 12-3pm ET

## Rules

### [Current Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/about/rules/)

They're pretty simple - be nice, don't solicit business, no self promotion

### New Rules

No AI generated comments/content - it's low quality, and we're not here to be AI fact checkers

No discussion of tax fraud - openly suggesting/supporting tax fraud calls into question the reliability of the comments here, of course people should always take reddit advice with a grain of salt, but suggesting fraud on top of that just degrades the subreddit

**Anything else specific that frequent subreddit users would like to see added?**

## AutoMod Commenter

I've removed all the oudated auto-comments/removal, here are the new ones I'm thinking of adding - note that these would just be an FYI comment on the post, the post itself would not be removed, just saves frequent users the effort of linking the same things or re-iterating the frequently asked questions around this time of year

 -  **Explaining how tax brackets work** - users could comment "!ELI5taxes", AutoMod would reply with a breakdown that's frequently repeated here - if someone has a preferred example they've seen here please link it in the comments

 -  **Explaining how tax refund works** - users could comment "!ELI5refund", AutoMod would reply with the paying cash at the grocery store example plus explaining lower refund vs lower paychecks

 -  **Return vs refund** - I've seen this one frequently mentioned as an AutoMod request, but I suspect figuring out the right regex trigger would be tricky as I wouldn't want it to just be blindly commented on every single post mentioning a tax return or refund

 -  **IRS withholding estimator** - [links to tool](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) for updating W4(s) with summary of frequent mistakes like double counting dependents for married couples or not properly accounting for multiple jobs

 -  **Dependents** - links to [IRS dependent tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/whom-may-i-claim-as-a-dependent), if someone wants to draft a summary with it then you're welcome to comment it here, just not sure if that's necessary as it could get lengthy 

 -  **Do I have to file** - link to [IRS tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return) plus summary

 -  **Others** - wishlist that may be helpful, but not sure if these are really needed/not sure of regex trigger

  - $600 threshold for 1099-K

  - Do I have to include x income?

  - How do I report income without a 1099/Do I have to? (similar to previous)

  - When will I get my refund?

 - 1099 vs W2 misclassification

 - Can I claim x if I work from home? (Think these have mostly died down the last 1-2 years)

**Open to any reasonable/genuine feedback on these from frequent users of the subreddit**

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The Reddit post and comments discuss various pain points and suggestions for improving the r/tax subreddit, particularly regarding AutoMod actions, rules, and user engagement. To address these concerns, I propose the following solution plan:

1. **AutoMod Commenter:** Develop an AI-powered AutoMod Commenter that can understand and respond to common tax-related queries. This can be achieved by training a large language model (LLM) on a dataset of tax-related questions and answers. The AutoMod Commenter can then be integrated with the subreddit to provide helpful responses to users.
2. **Rules and Moderation:** Update the subreddit's rules to include a clear policy on AI-generated content and tax fraud. Implement a moderation system that allows users to report suspicious or fraudulent activity.
3. **User Engagement:** Encourage user engagement by creating a community-driven FAQ section on the subreddit. This can be achieved by allowing users to submit and vote on questions and answers. The community can then work together to create a comprehensive FAQ that addresses common tax-related queries.
4. **AMA (Ask Me Anything) Announcements:** Continue to host AMAs with tax professionals and experts to provide users with valuable insights and information. These AMAs can be announced in advance to generate excitement and encourage user participation.

**Timeline:**

1. **Week 1-2:** Develop and train the AutoMod Commenter using a large language model.
2. **Week 3-4:** Integrate the AutoMod Commenter with the subreddit and update the rules and moderation policies.
3. **Week 5-6:** Launch the community-driven FAQ section and encourage user engagement.
4. **Week 7-8:** Host the next AMA and plan for future AMAs.

**Solution Map:**

1. Identify common tax-related queries and questions asked in the subreddit.
2. Train a large language model on a dataset of tax-related questions and answers.
3. Develop an AI-powered AutoMod Commenter that can understand and respond to common tax-related queries.
4. Integrate the AutoMod Commenter with the subreddit and update the rules and moderation policies.
5. Create a community-driven FAQ section on the subreddit and encourage user engagement.
6. Host AMAs with tax professionals and experts to provide users with valuable insights and information.
7. Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the solution plan and make adjustments as needed.

By implementing this solution plan, the r/tax subreddit can become a more valuable resource for users, providing them with accurate and helpful information and a supportive community to engage with.

I’m KYC verified on the platform where I play, mainly sports betting, but I always withdraw my winnings in cash. Just wondering, can I still be taxed on this? Since I’m withdrawing in cash, does it make a difference when it comes to taxes, or should I be reporting this somehow?   
  
Trying to stay on the right side of things but not sure how this works with cash withdrawals. Would appreciate any advice or insight from those who’ve been in a similar situation. Thanks!

### URL:

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The pain point being discussed is the uncertainty around taxation of gambling winnings, specifically cash withdrawals from a sports betting platform. To address this, we can leverage AI Agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Automation platforms to provide clear guidance on tax obligations.

**Step 1:** Utilize an LLM to analyze tax laws and regulations related to gambling winnings in the user's country. This will help identify the specific tax implications and requirements.

**Step 2:** Develop an AI Agent that can interact with the user to gather necessary information, such as:

* The platform used for sports betting
* The frequency and amount of withdrawals
* The user's tax filing status and jurisdiction

The AI Agent will then use this information to provide personalized tax guidance, including:

* Whether the user is required to report their winnings to the tax authorities
* The tax rate applicable to their winnings
* Any potential deductions or credits available

**Step 3:** Implement an Automation platform (Make.com) to create a workflow that connects the user's sports betting platform, the AI Agent, and the tax authorities. This will enable the user to:

* Automatically track their winnings and losses
* Receive notifications when tax reporting is due
* Easily submit required tax forms and documents

**Timeline:**

* Step 1: 1-2 weeks to analyze tax laws and regulations
* Step 2: 1-2 weeks to develop the AI Agent and gather necessary information
* Step 3: 2-4 weeks to implement the Automation platform and connect the necessary systems
* Total estimated time: 6-10 weeks

**Solution Map:**

1. Analyze tax laws and regulations
2. Develop AI Agent and gather necessary information
3. Implement Automation platform and connect systems
4. Provide personalized tax guidance to the user
5. Enable user to track winnings and losses, receive notifications, and submit tax forms
6. Monitor and update the solution as needed to ensure compliance with changing tax regulations and laws

By leveraging these technologies, we can provide a comprehensive solution to address the user's pain point and ensure they are in compliance with tax regulations.

### Post Content:
We bought a house in 2017 and sold it in 2022 for $170k more than what we paid. It was our main residence. My understanding was, given the above, that gain is not taxable and I didn’t have to report it on my tax return. But, I recently got a CP2501 notice stating that we failed to report it as compensation. Apparently they received a 1099 from the closing law firm. I have a 1099 from them as well. I need to respond stating whether or not I agree with this change, and if I agree, they will send me a notice stating the additional tax I owe. 

Is my understanding correct that I should not owe tax on the sale? If I am correct, how do I prove this to the IRS? The instructions are very vague. I called them and the agent just said she’s not a tax lawyer and she cannot confirm whether or not I should owe taxes, and she recommended I go to a CPA. 

Update: I looked at my TurboTax account and I HAD put all the info about the sale in there, but it did not generate a Schedule D. I called them and we walked through my info together. It turns out that there is a step saying “it is not mandatory to report this to the IRS. Check this box to report it anyway.” I hadn’t checked that box. If I check it, then it generates a Schedule D which says that I don’t owe anything. So they recommended that I amend my return including that new form. Hopefully all is well from here. Thanks all!

Update 2: Thanks again to everyone yelling at me not to amend. I will submit a new Schedule D, the 1099S, and if I can find it, evidence of the purchase price of the house.

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The problem at hand is that the taxpayer received a CP2501 notice from the IRS stating that they failed to report a gain from the sale of their main residence, despite understanding that the gain is not taxable. The taxpayer believes that the gain is not taxable because they lived in the house for at least two years and the gain is less than the exclusion threshold. However, the IRS received a 1099-S from the closing law firm and is requiring the taxpayer to report the gain.

To address this issue, we will use AI Agents, LLMs, and automation platforms to create a solution plan. The plan will involve the following steps:

### Post Content:
Located in OH, USA

Long story short - my employer pays $20k a year towards my student loans. Last year (2023) was the first year they did this, and they made the payment directly to my lender.  They did not provide a 1099 and they did not include it on my W2.  I am also guessing they don’t have a formal student loan repayment program as they are a rural hospital.

I did not report any of this on my taxes. I am a physician and made slightly less than $380k last year.

Feels like I should file the amendment now instead of waiting for them to find out but wanted to get your opinions to make sure there aren’t any other options I should consider.

### Solution Plan:
SOLUTION IS :

**Solution Plan:**

The pain point is that the employer failed to provide a 1099 and W2 for the student loan payment, making it uncertain whether the payment is reported to the IRS. As a high-income individual, it is crucial to ensure accurate tax reporting to avoid potential audits and penalties.

**Step 1:** Check IRS Transcript
Use AI Agents to analyze the Reddit comments and recommend checking the IRS transcript to verify if the employer-reported student loan payment. This will help determine if the payment is already reported to the IRS, eliminating the need for an amended return.

**Step 2:** Verify W2 and 1099
If the payment is not reported on the W2, use Large Language Models to draft a polite email to the employer requesting a 1099 or W2 for the student loan payment. This will provide clarity on the reporting status.

**Step 3:** Consult a Tax Professional
As a physician, it is essential to have a professional tax advisor. Use Automation platforms like Make.com to create a workflow connecting tax preparation software and accounting services. This will enable seamless communication and ensure accurate tax reporting.

**Step 4:** Amend Return (if necessary)
If the payment is not reported, and the employer fails to provide a 1099 or W2, it may be necessary to amend the tax return. Use Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the situation and provide personalized guidance on the amendment process.

**Timeline:**

* Step 1: Check IRS Transcript - 1-2 days
* Step 2: Verify W2 and 1099 - 1-2 weeks
* Step 3: Consult a Tax Professional - Ongoing
* Step 4: Amend Return (if necessary) - 2-4 weeks

**Solution Map:**

1. Check IRS Transcript
2. Verify W2 and 1099
3. Consult a Tax Professional
4. Amend Return (if necessary)

**Recommendations:**

* As a physician, consider hiring a tax professional to ensure accurate tax reporting and minimize exposure risks.
* Use AI Agents and Large Language Models to streamline tax preparation and compliance.
* Automation platforms like Make.com can help connect various tax preparation software and accounting services, ensuring seamless communication and accurate tax reporting.

**Additional Tips:**
